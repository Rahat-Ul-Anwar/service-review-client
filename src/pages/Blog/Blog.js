          <p>
            SQL is the programming language used to interface with relational
            databases. (Relational databases model data as records in rows and
            tables with logical links between them).
          </p>
          <p>
            NoSQL is a class of DBMs that are non-relational and generally do
            not use SQL.

          <p>
            JWTor JSON Web Token, is an open standard used to share security
            information between two parties â€” a client and a server. Each JWT
            contains encoded JSON objects, including a set of claims. JWTs are
            signed using a cryptographic algorithm to ensure that the claims
            cannot be altered after the token is issued.

            3. What is the difference between javascript and NodeJS?
          </h2>
          <p>
            Javascript is a Scripting language.Javascript is a high-level
            programming language that uses the concept of Oops but it is based
            on prototype inheritance
          </p>
          <p>
            NodeJS is a cross-platform and open source Javascript runtime
            environment that allows the javascript to be run on the server-side.
            Nodejs allows Javascript code to run outside the browser. Nodejs
            comes with a lot of modules and mostly used in web development.

            4. How does NodeJS handle multiple requests at the same time?
          </h2>
          <p>
            NodeJS receives multiple client requests and places them into
            EventQueue. NodeJS is built with the concept of event-driven
            architecture. NodeJS has its own EventLoop which is an infinite loop
            that receives requests and processes them. EventLoop is the listener
            for the EventQueue.{" "}
